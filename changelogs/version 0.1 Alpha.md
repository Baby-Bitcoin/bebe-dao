# Changelog v0.1 🦋

> _"Only One Eternal Rule: Curate this log yourself as a developer, yes You, adding your own unique point of view on the development timeline, respecting the .MD text formatting (just use chatGPT with this prompt formula: "Format this changelog with creative .MD formatting, reply only with the code")."_

## 🌟 Highlights

- **Created `butterfly.js`** - Introducing: "The smallest in-memory Node.js DB software in the World." 🦋 Why did we embark on this seemingly small but mighty journey?  
  - 🌌 Because **Quantum Computers** are on the horizon, ready to **shatter** our most popular encryption methods (like SSL, RSA, etc.) using Shor's Algorithm. Just imagine: cracking codes in mere seconds! 
  - 🔍 Because **Redis, Docker, and other widespread Database solutions** might already be compromised! 🕵️‍♂️ 🚨 Malicious code is spreading like wildfire, mining cryptocurrency, or stealing precious crypto keys.

- **Removed** `redis.js "rejson"` script and `@ioredis` package – we’ve waved goodbye to these old pals and replaced them with the sleeker, lighter `butterfly.js`. ✌️

- **Removed** `@https` and `@cors` packages – because who needs extra baggage?

## ✍️ Upcoming Adventures

- **Creating (soon, not just yet)** a separate repo for `butterfly.js` – "The smallest in-memory Node.js DB software in the World" complete with documentation in the README file.  
  - License: **GPL 3.0**

- **Creating (eventually, but it’s on the radar)** an NPM package for `butterfly.js`. 📦

## 🔧 Improvements & Fixes

- **Enhanced UI Details**: Tweaked and improved error message modals and added loading indicators for more situations. Minor refactoring sprinkled throughout. ✨

- **Moved Wallet Balance Checking to the Back-end** – It's safer there. Trust us. 🔐

- **Code Cleanup**: Removed the cruft – unused code, outdated comments, and general untidiness be gone!

## 🛠️ Work in Progress

- **Comments are Broken** – and we don't yet know why. It's like a mystery novel, and we're still reading Chapter One… 🔍

**Next Version?** Sure thing, but remember to bump that version number up just a little next time. 😉  
Stay tuned for more exciting updates, coming your way soon! 🚀
